# Database-for-Online-Shop-via-Hibernate
In this project i illustrate, how we can create a database of an online shop via Hibernate. I created all needed tabels and columns for this, and defined some objects 
as an example. All tables are included in package Pojo, and main App with objects instance and session factory is included in main class app near package Pojo.
